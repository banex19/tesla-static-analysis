TESLA: Temporally Enforced Security Logic Assertions
====================================================================

TESLA is a tool that allow programmers to add temporal assertions to
their security-critical code. Rather than simply asserting that
"a particular expression evaluates to true right now", programmers
can specify temporal properties such as "this access control check
occurs before that object is used".

A programmer's guide (including build instuctions) can be found at:

Static Analysis Extensions
====================================================================

As part of my Part III research project, I will be investigating how static
analysis can be used to optimise TESLA assertions.

This repository is set up as a clone of the main TESLA repository, and can be
updated from there. My work will initially be pushed only to this repository
(while my project is in progress).
